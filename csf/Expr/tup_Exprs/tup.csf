Expr ::= tup(Expr*)

Alias:	tuple

Glossary:

The evaluations of the sub-expressions may be interleaved.
A tuple is formed from the resulting sequence.

When each sub-expression has a (possibly different) type,
the tuple expression has the tuple type formed from those types.

1:      Expr2 --> Expr2'
        ---
        tup(Expr*1,Expr2,Expr*3) --> tup(Expr*1,Expr2',Expr*3) %% ambiguous

%% 2:      Expr* ==> Expr*' : Type*
%%         ---
%%         tup(Expr*) ==> tup(Expr*') : tup-type(Type*)
